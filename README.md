# MIFrame

The MIFrame framework defines "Frame" object for macOS and iOS.
The frame is used to implement components besed on it:
* GUI component
* Database component

In short, the frame is mutable dictionary which has multiple key and value pairs. The frame has following values:
* single link for it's parent
* multiple links for it's child frames
* single link for prototype

The concept of the frame is inspired by [The NewtonScript Programming Language](https://www.newted.org/download/manuals/NewtonScriptProgramLanguage.pdf).
